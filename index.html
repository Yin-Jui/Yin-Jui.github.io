              There are many distractions in this day and age, in the form of
              video games, TV shows, streaming websites, etc. Although
              distractions can enrich our daily lives, it might also make it
              hard for people to focus on their job or studies, which leads to
              procrastination. If you feel like you have not been productive
              enough due to distractions around you, AN·TIC·I·PATE aims to
              provide solutions to address these very problems. With

              meeting to assemble an affinity diagram and analyze our findings.
              We highlighted important information from each interview and tried
              to group them. We went through different grouping processes until
              we narrowed them down into five main categories with multiple
              subcategories, resulting in three layers of notes for our data.

              After conducting our interviews, we created an affinity diagram
              and separated our affinity notes into the following themes:
              <br />

              <br />
              <p>
                <strong
                  >1. People like to make a distinction between their work time
                  and their play time.</strong
                ><br />
                Many interviewees noted that they liked to schedule work time
                blocks and non-work time blocks. During those work blocks they
                would try to be as productive as possible on work and not use
                other applications or devices to break focus. However, this also
                results quickly in mental fatigue and people will be inclined to
                take more breaks to relax themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong
                  >2. People are exposed to plenty of distractions.</strong
                >
                <br />
                We asked our participants to briefly check and describe their
                Screen Time on their phones, and the majority of them happen to
                use a lot of social media and entertainment applications, like
                Tiktok and Instagram. Social networking introduces plenty of
                opportunities for fear of missing out (FOMO), and it leads to
                people picking up their devices to check social media more often
                than not.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong
                  >3. People try to utilize the time to its fullest potential.
                </strong>
                <br />
                There were also a number of participants that would meticulously
                plan out their day, and review their tasks at the end of the
                day. We found that these same people also were more productive
                and did not feel tired or stressed at the end of the day because
                their schedule was “just right”.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong
                  >4. People use various tools to aid in time management.
                </strong>
                <br />
                Some interviewees indicated that they have used tools like
                calendars, reminders, alarm clock and Notion, a website that
                help users organize jobs, to keep themselves on track of their
                schedules.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong
                  >5. People like to start the day by doing something
                  productive.</strong
                >
                <br />

                We found that most people seemed to power through the day
                staying productive if they began the day by first exercising,
                doing housework, or simply just planning out their day. One
                interviewee said, “Once I start working, it is hard to stop.”
                People also tend to complete easy tasks before they start
                working on the hard tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  6. Technology is more of a hassle than it is a
                  blessing.</strong
                >
                <br />
                Some of the older participants found it difficult to manage
                technology, and preferred time scheduling the manual way -- pen,
                paper and post-it notes. Many participants also mentioned that
                they have not used a habit tracker before, some of which was
                because it was confusing and hard to use.

              We created multiple iterations of our application design using
              Figma. We started with a low fidelity wireframe and gradually made
              changes to increase the fidelity, while fixing usability issues
              that we discovered during user and heuristic evaluations.

              After creating the wireframes, we each had 2 participants perform
              several tasks on the wireframes as part of our user evaluation
              process to find issues. These issues were used to improve the
              fidelity of the wireframe into a higher-fidelity prototype, as
              shown below. The tasks the users were asked to perform were a mix
              of broad reflective tasks and specific goal-oriented tasks:
            </p>
            <ol>

                Set up your user account, including activities and distractions.
              </li>
              <li>
                While on the Work Timer Original State page, what do you think
                about the setup process?
              </li>
              <li>
                Could you start, stop, and reset the timer? After that, try to
                enter the break phase.
              </li>
              <li>
                While on the Work Timer Original State page, could you take a
                look at the page in front of you and tell me what you can do on
                this page?
              </li>
              <li>
                Could you please add one task to the to-do list, try to change
                its information, give it a difficulty of 10, then delete the
                task?

              Based on the findings of the user evaluations, we compiled a list

              used the result to construct our high-fidelity prototype. After
              that, we individually compiled our own list of usability issues

              After extensive user research, ideation, usability testing, and
              iterations, we aimed to design a system that helps people stay
              focused while they are working, while guiding them to stay
              productive while they're taking a break. Our goal can be achieved
              by implementing the <strong>Pomodoro technique</strong>, a
              technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals,
              traditionally 25 minutes in length, intervened with short breaks.
              During the break period, activities will be recommended for users
              to do with our state-of-the-art recommendation system. The
              activities can be either defined by users themselves or randomly
              suggested by our application.

              for pushing us to finish the homework as early as possible.
              Yin-Jui is an excellent teammate, who teaches me a lot during the
              spring quarter. He is my best friend now. Finally, I still want to
              thank Professor for connecting us magically.

              Joshua Kuan: I enjoyed the lectures and interesting topics
              discussed in class. I liked that the information was continuously
              curated for us, especially towards the end. Also would like to say
              thank you to my teammates for being able to carry on working
              around my weird schedule because of my part time job
            </p>

              Yin-Jui Liao: I would like to say thank you to Professor Matt for
              the hard work you put into this course and the TAs for providing
              all the help we need. During the quarter, we learned a lot as a
              team through the process of building an interesting project from
              scratch. Seeing our project getting better after interviews, user
              evaluations, and self-heuristic evaluations gives me a great sense
              of achievement. Finally, thanks to my teammates for being
              collaborative and supportive and all the participants of our
              interviews and evaluations. With your help, our project gets to
              improve over time.
