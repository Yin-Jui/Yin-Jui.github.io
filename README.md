# Project Deliverable 7: UX Design Case Study Page

## Author: Xinyi Hu, Joshua Kuan, Yin-Jui Liao

The repo includes an `index.html` file, images are in the `images` folder, and we have one `style.css` file in the `styles` folder. We have included `valid-html.jpg`, `valid-css.jpg` and `valid-accessiblity.jpg` in the root directory.

### List of basic HTML content, CSS styling and advanced features we included in this project:

- At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s)
- Appropriate headings and paragraph text
- Links to external page(s)
- Optional: Adding custom icons from Google Material Icons (Links to an external site.), Font Awesome (Links to an external site.), or similar

- Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
- Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, perhaps with a pallette creator like Adobe Color CC (Links to an external site.) or Paletton (Links to an external site.)
- Adding custom font(s) from Google fonts (Links to an external site.) to add more personality (make sure to include appropriate fallbacks)

- Creating a more complex page layout, such as including a sidebar or navigation bar
- Embedded HTML5 media, like video or audio, with fallbacks
